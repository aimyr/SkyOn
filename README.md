# SkyOn
My agricultural project

Synopsis. We offer our solution called SkyOn: a system consisting of drones, sensors, base stations, and a cloud platform for data processing—designed for the agricultural industry to make GIS(geographic information system) research more accessible. By leveraging modern drone technology and artificial intelligence with computer vision, we can make every person a GIS researcher

 Problem. The primary challenge in Kazakhstan is that floods and droughts, leading to desertification, worsen yearly. These catastrophic events happen annually, yet the government is never fully prepared. Global climate change exacerbates these disasters, making them even more destructive. This is a critical issue for not only our agricultural sector but for all who live in that region. However, the problem extends far beyond Kazakhstan. Worldwide, approximately one trillion US dollars are spent each year to address the impacts of floods and droughts, underscoring this global concern's massive scale. Despite these investments, many countries remain unprepared. Locally, we face poor-quality maps and poor performance of map creation services. maps, which currently have a resolution of about ten square kilometers and lack of service—making it impossible to accurately model and predict water movement. In nations like the United States and Canada, non-profit organizations (e.g., the Red River Basin organization) focus on educating farmers and conducting independent research, yet in Kazakhstan and other developing countries, land-scanning services are still limited. People in rural areas are slow to adopt digital technologies and rarely have the opportunity to learn GIS independently.

 Solution.  We aim to provide everyone with the tools needed to support agricultural development in emerging economies while ensuring their safety. This objective is achievable through AI and computer vision, which allow drone-collected data to be analyzed at a professional level. Acknowledging that GIS can be challenging even for experts, we propose a system of drones and sensors that perform research on behalf of the users. Rather than learning GIS themselves for years, farmers can make the SkyOn drones to accomplish their tasks. The system then presents maps, graphs, or 3D models explains what it all means, and suggests solutions. Our system will consist of a base station, a drone, sensors, and a cloud platform powered by AI. Our drone is equipped with a Pixhawk autopilot, but it does not perform any data analysis in the air; instead, it records footage that is immediately uploaded to the cloud. The base station acts as a charging station for the drone, functions as a weather station, and provides both charging and storage for the sensors used for manual data collection.

Main Functions of the Device.  The device autonomously surveys selected areas via drones and sensors, eliminating the need for extensive GIS knowledge. AI-based computer vision processes the collected data, offering insights on land use, crop health, water management, and other important parameters. Because drones can be deployed frequently—potentially even hourly—farmers,   ranchers, and local officials gain real-time information, which is vital in crises. Finally, our system generates clear visual outputs (such as maps, 3D models, or graphs), and recommendations making data-driven decision-making more intuitive. We use ArduPilot to program our drone, which is equipped with RTK to conduct surveys at an extremely precise level. The base station runs on a Jetson Nano, allowing it to read and process various signals—a task that requires considerable computing power, which this device can handle. As for the weather station, it will be a standard setup with sensors for wind, water, sunlight, lightning, and so on—basically, a ready-made station that can be purchased off the shelf. Our biggest challenge lies in the software. We plan to employ different neural networks for different tasks, ensuring that each one can solve its specific problem as efficiently as possible. Some tasks won’t require neural networks at all, using only standard algorithms, for example, when creating a basic terrain map. The neural networks will integrate all data collected by the drone, including infrared, near-infrared, visible-range imagery, LiDAR-based terrain maps, and sensor readings. First, we’ll generate a base model using a simple script; then, the neural network will analyze each part of that model and produce the final result. At present, we’re focused on developing scripts for automated model creation using the drone. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, We are confident that it is viable to overcome them.

Customer Profile.  Our customers range from governments tackling large-scale natural disasters to small, medium, or large agricultural enterprises. Ranchers who raise livestock and organizations focusing on environmental protection or ecotourism also benefit. Many developing nations have allocated substantial budgets to solving water-related problems; Kazakhstan, for instance, plans to invest 35 billion dollars in this sector by 2050.

Unique Value Proposition.  We focus on accessibility for developing countries, bridging the gap caused by a lack of quality DTM data and scarce GIS resources. Our drone-centric approach is far more cost-effective than satellite imagery and can be deployed on demand. Since the system automates both data collection and analysis, advanced GIS expertise is unnecessary. Our commitment to open-source solutions invites specialists and researchers worldwide to collaborate and share data for broader ecological and scientific goals. By bolstering monitoring and resource management, we can soften the effects of climate change and limit losses from environmental disasters.

 Business Traction. Overall, SkyOn addresses a total global market estimated at 60 billion dollars, covering agriculture, emergency response, and ecotourism. In Kazakhstan alone, the serviceable addressable market reaches an estimated 500 million dollars across these sectors, while the initial serviceable obtainable market, focusing on flood prevention, stands at about 50 million dollars annually. This initial target sets the stage for further growth as more stakeholders recognize the value of drone-based GIS and analysis.

 Device Development Traction.  We are currently polishing our prototype. The project traces its roots to a previous our other project, Korso, through which we tested drone functionalities and GIS capabilities using DJI drones. Participation in the GCIP accelerator program reinforced our aims, leading us to spin off SkyOn as a project dedicated specifically to these solutions. Based on the Pixhawk platform, we are building both a quadcopter and a VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) fixed-wing drone. This extensive development period gives us time and flexibility to refine the design and performance of our products.  However, our primary product is the software—specifically, our innovative neural network, which we are developing in collaboration with leading experts from the Kazakh-British Technical University, as well as West Michigan and Nebraska universities.

Our Achievements.  To date, we have concluded the Korso pilot program that explored drone-based GIS research, participated in the GCIP accelerator, verified all essential drone functions and GIS features, and are now finalizing the SkyOn prototypes, including both quadcopter and fixed-wing VTOL models. We are currently researchers under a grant from the Ministry of Higher Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan where we are creating a solution to this problem by exploring various methods. The Jai Sagin, the main contributor for this project, supported our idea and our drone is now one of the parts of the research BR27197639  “Innovations to reduce the consequences of floods and droughts with hydrogeological strategies for controlled recharge of aquifers for Zhambyl, Almaty, Zhetysu, Abay and East Kazakhstan regions.” It’s great that we are part of this grant—it will provide us with learning materials, access to various conferences, technical support, specialists, and data.

The Revenue Model. Our drone’s production cost is $5,000, but we plan to sell it for $6,000. We intend to earn most of our revenue from a $100 subscription. By focusing on subscriptions, we aim to build a steady user base rather than relying solely on one-time hardware sales. Of course, we will eventually increase our prices for various configurations, such as a fixed-wing drone with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). We will also raise prices and add markups for more sophisticated models intended for larger companies and governments. At the moment, we are introducing a version suited for small businesses or individual users. Cameras are very expensive, especially the professional models required for this type of research. To make such studies affordable for everyone, we plan to offer a camera rental service. Initially, we will take a deposit to safeguard our equipment. For new clients, the first month’s rental fee will be set at 5% of the camera’s cost. If you prove trustworthy, you will then pay 2.5% per month afterward. In addition, we will provide servicing and maintenance—using parts manufactured by us—to generate extra revenue through repairs. Essentially, this is how we plan to make money.
